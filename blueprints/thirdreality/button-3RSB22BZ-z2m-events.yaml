  name: Zigbee2MQTT - Third Reality 3RSB22BZ Button Controller (Device Trigger)
  description: >-
    Control lights, scenes, or other devices using a Third Reality 3RSB22BZ
    Zigbee button connected via Zigbee2MQTT (Z2M).
    Uses modern MQTT Device Triggers (no legacy action sensor required).
    Handles single press, double press, hold, and release actions.
  domain: automation
  input:
